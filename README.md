# TeslaNews
Built this app using 'News API' to display news article related to 'Tesla' from a particular date. I built it just to learn how data is fetched using an api in android.
API key has to be inserted at 
TeslaNews/TeslaNews/src/main/java/com/learning/teslanews/api/TeslaNewsApi.kt.
You can also change the date from which articles are fetched to a date of your choice there.
